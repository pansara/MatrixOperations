# MatrixOperations
A C# program that performs all kinds of Matrix Operations

## Addition

```
Which matrix operation do you want to perform:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Product
4. Scalar Multiplication
5. Transpose
6. Determinant

Enter the option:1
Enter the number of Rows for Matrix1
2
Enter the number of Columns for Matrix1
3
Enter the number of Rows for Matrix2
2
Enter the number of Columns for Matrix2
2
Both the matrix should be of same dimensions
```
